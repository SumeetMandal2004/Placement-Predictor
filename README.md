# Student Placement Analytics & Prediction System

A Machine Learning web application that predicts whether a student will get placed based on academic performance and background.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn
- Streamlit
- Git & GitHub

## Key Findings from EDA
- Students with work experience have **86% placement rate** vs 59% without
- **10th percentage** is the strongest academic predictor of placement
- MBA percentage has very little impact on placement outcome
- Class imbalance: 68.8% Placed vs 31.2% Not Placed

## Model Performance
|       Model           | Accuracy  | Overfitting |

| Logistic Regression   | 83.72%    |   No        |
| Decision Tree         | 83.72%    |   Yes       |
| Random Forest         | 76.74%    |   Yes       |

**Best Model: Logistic Regression** — best generalization on small dataset
